# Kolmogrov Arnold Networks vs Multi-Layer Perceptrons 

Provide a description of your project including 

1. Motivation for the Research Question
While analyzing the paper written by Ziming Lui and partners,it was stated that the new network called KANs were going to overperform the MLPs in terms of convergence rate and accuracy with minimum number of layers. The outcome of their research seemed promising but in order to come to be sure as a researcher, I decided to test the claim made and compare both models together to ascertain what was said 
2. Research Question
I came up with three research question to prove/ refute this claim.
I. 
II.
III.

3. Methodology 

4. Briefly mention and discuss your results


5. Draw your conclusions
